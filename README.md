PDF file has the describtion of the whole project
but it's important to NOTICE The following:
in Page 2 (connections) 
I used potentiometer just to test during the simulation runtime in proteus
as the flex sensor are just resistors it is not possible to change their values during 
protues simulation. for the "real world" connections all resistors with "FLEX" label & the potentiometer will be replaced by flex sensors
